# Salesforce NFC Writer from Contact Record Page

!!!writes to NFC card, make sure you experiment on an empty card to prevent any irreversible changes


## Notes

- Place the nfcWriter lwc on a contact record page.
- for purpose of demonstrating mobile capabilities
- not sure if needed, but utilising Financial Force's metadata api, and also named credential callout to access photo url (since they were already setup in org from previous experiments)
